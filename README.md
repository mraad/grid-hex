This library implements the following functions:
- Convert XY world coordinates into Hex RowCol.
- Convert Hex center into XY world coordinates.
- Get a sequence of the Hex corners in world coordinates.
- Get a sequence of Hexes that are within a user defined range from a given Hex.

## Building the Project

```
mvn clean install
```

Install python modules:

```
python setup install
```

~~The build process is based on [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).~~

```
sbt clean cleanFiles transitiveUpdate +publishM2 +publishLocal
```

## ~~Hex Viewer~~

~~`HexApp` is a simple CLI application to view the above functions in action.~~

~~View the app usage using:~~

```
sbt "run -help"
```

~~The following is a sample execution:~~

```
sbt "run -w 400 -h 400 -x 253 -y 177 -r 3 -o /tmp/test.png" && open /tmp/test.png
```
